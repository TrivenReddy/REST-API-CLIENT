##DESCRIPTION:Project demonstrates how to consume a public REST API, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch and display weather data in a structured format. The application uses Java's built-in HttpClient to send HTTP requests and org.json to parse the JSON responses. The user provides a city name as input, and the program retrieves real-time weather details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.Used EclipseIDE for executing the project.
WeatherAPIClient: The main Java file that handles user input, makes API requests, and processes the response.
Dependencies Used:org.json: A simple JSON library for parsing API responses.
API Used:A free and publicly available weather API that provides weather data for cities worldwide.
